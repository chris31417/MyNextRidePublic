INSTALLED ABOVE MODULES BUT DISABLED SINCE THEY 
SEEM TO BE OBSOLETE
I left them in in case we need to roll back

last vehiclemanager PRO is dated Aug 2014 and
numbered 3.3.1

looks reasonably easy to make other mods
e.g. delete 'rent' lines from /var/www/html/component/com_vehiclemanager/view/tmpl/default.php

see ./VehicleManager for installed modules
