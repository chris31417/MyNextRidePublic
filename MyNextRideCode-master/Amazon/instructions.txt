I would like to connect with
A standalone SSH client
A Java SSH Client directly from my browser (Java required)
To access your instance:
Open an SSH client. (find out how to connect using PuTTY)
Locate your private key file (mynextride-site-keys.pem). The wizard automatically detects the key you used to launch the instance.
Your key must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Use this command if needed:
chmod 400 mynextride-site-keys.pem
Connect to your instance using its Public IP:
54.174.208.131
Example:
ssh -i mynextride-site-keys.pem ubuntu@54.174.208.131
